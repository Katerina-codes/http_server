# HTTP SERVER

This is the start of an implementation of a HTTP server based on the HTTP Cob Spec.


## Running the program:

Step 1:
```
git clone git@github.com:Katerina-codes/http_server.git
```

Step 2:
```
cd into http_server
```

Make sure gradle is installed then build the program using gradle:

Step 3:
```
gradle jar
```

## Running the acceptance tests

Clone `cob_spec`:
```
git clone git@github.com:8thlight/cob_spec.git
```

Follow the instructions in Cob Spec README to configure it so that it points to the jar you've built in step 3.

## Running the HTTP Server tests

Tests are currently run from within Intellij.
